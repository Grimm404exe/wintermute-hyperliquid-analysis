WINTERMUTE'S HYPERLIQUID MARKET MAKING OPERATION

I reverse engineered Wintermute's quoting strategy on Hyperliquid.

Here's what I found 🧵

---

1/ THE SETUP

Wintermute runs a ~$95M operation on Hyperliquid:
- $57.8M perp account
- $37M+ in spot holdings
- 1,732 resting orders
- 76 markets quoted
- $199M total quoted notional

Wallet: 0xecb63caa47c7c4e77f60f1ce858cf28dc2b82b00

---

2/ QUOTING OVERVIEW

Total bid notional: $101.7M (51%)
Total ask notional: $97.2M (49%)

Near-perfect symmetry. This is textbook professional market making.

---

3/ TOP MARKETS BY QUOTED NOTIONAL

BTC:  $78.1M  (105 orders, 0.96 bps spread)
ETH:  $32.0M  (103 orders, 2.19 bps spread)
SOL:  $14.1M  (54 orders, 1.39 bps spread)
HYPE: $9.7M   (27 orders, 23.8 bps spread)
XRP:  $9.6M   (58 orders, 8.07 bps spread)
DOGE: $9.1M   (38 orders, 4.18 bps spread)

---

4/ THE TIERED SIZE STRUCTURE

Wintermute uses ~11 size tiers per market with a consistent 2.5-2.8x multiplier between tiers.

Smaller sizes near mid with tight spreads.
Larger sizes further out with wider spreads.

5/ BTC QUOTING LADDER

Distance   Size      Notional
0.001%     0.05 BTC  $4.7K
0.003%     0.11 BTC  $10.3K
0.010%     0.37 BTC  $34.6K
0.030%     2.67 BTC  $250K
0.080%     13.4 BTC  $1.25M
0.200%     27.5 BTC  $2.57M

---

6/ SPREAD ANALYSIS

Large cap (BTC, ETH): 1.6 bps avg spread
Mid cap (SOL, XRP, etc): 8.2 bps avg spread
Small cap: 45 bps avg spread

Tighter spreads = more volume expected
Wider spreads = adverse selection protection

---

7/ INVENTORY POSITION

Total perp positions: 83 markets
Net exposure: $177M SHORT

This is accumulated inventory from market making - NOT a directional bet.

They're quoting across venues and inventory accumulates where the flow is. Offset on CEXs.

---

8/ TOP POSITIONS (accumulated inventory)

ETH:  $88.3M SHORT
SOL:  $22.2M SHORT
HYPE: $21.2M SHORT
XRP:  $8.8M SHORT
DOGE: $5.7M SHORT
BTC:  $2.0M LONG

---

9/ SPOT HOLDINGS

UBTC: $9.5M
USDC: $9.1M
UETH: $6.4M
HYPE: $4.2M
USDH: $2.2M
USOL: $2.2M
USDT: $1.7M

Total spot: ~$37M

---

10/ THE STRATEGY

This is consistent with Avellaneda-Stoikov optimal market making:

✓ Inventory-aware quoting
✓ Symmetric bid/ask exposure
✓ Tiered size structure
✓ Spreads scale with adverse selection risk

---

11/ KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. Professional MMs run balanced books
2. Size scales with distance from mid
3. Spread scales inversely with volume
4. Inventory accumulates - they hedge elsewhere
5. ~$95M total capital deployed on Hyperliquid
